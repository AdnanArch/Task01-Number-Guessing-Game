# Task01-Number-Guessing-Game

## Description

This is the first task of the CodSoft Internship Program. It's a simple number guessing game developed in Java using the Swing framework. The user is presented with a graphical user interface where they can guess a randomly generated number. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, helping the player to narrow down their guess until they find the correct number.

## Features
